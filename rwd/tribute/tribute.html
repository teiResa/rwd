          <h2> 8 months of testing, medication, and hoping for the best. </h2>
					<ul>

						<li><em><b>December 7</b></em>	- Miaou moves in with us. She is around 5 months old.
               Within a few days her nose begins to water, she begins to cough.
            We think little of it, as our apartment is cement with wall-mounted
            heater/AC units. It's always cold. Everyone is sniffling along with her.</li>
            <li><em><b>2020</b></em>	2020</li>
            <br>

						<li><em><strong>January</strong></em>	- Miaou had her first visit to the vet. Various of
               her white blood cell numbers are too high.
               <li> She is now diagnosed with an Upper Respritory Tract infection (a URI), Feline Calicivirus (FCV), and pneumonia. </li>
               <li>The next week consisted of
               daily trips to the vet. To save her the stress of the vet's, I built her a personal
               chamber at home. The vet found the appropriate nubuliser compressor. Miaou had to spend
                an hour every morning in a nebuliser chamber breathing in her medications.</li>
                <li> While treating her at home, the vet increased her to two hours <i> in the box</i> daily. This continued on
                a 'four days on, four days off' pattern with weekly blood tests, fSAA tests, and x-rays in between
                for the next 5 weeks. Pills started the day of her first visit to the vet.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Feburary</strong></em> - For the next 5 weeks, she receives varying combinations of
              pills and droppers. The vet tells us that she will more than likely have lung damage for the rest of her life. </li>
						<li><em><strong>March</strong></em>	- After much of a battle, Miaou is healthy enough
               that she doesn't see the vet for another month. Now to see whether her body is strong enough
               to fight the pneumonia on its own.</li>
						<li><em><strong> March </strong></em>	- By now she seems like a completely different girl, energy wise. After much
               consideration, decided to commence with toilet training. </li>
            <li><em><strong> April </strong></em> - By the end of the month, she is completely toilet trained.
              The pills and dropper continue. </li>
            <li><em><strong> May </strong></em> - Miaou is now diagnosed with a bacterial infection in her fecies. She
               showed immediate improvement, so the final IV would be cancelled. So then, two IVs and a sachet of
               Montmorillonite powder later, we have to quantify her poop for the next month. </li>
            <li> April and May blood tests have matched. Everything is starting to feel better.</li>
            <li><em><strong> June </strong></em> - With an fSAA result of 0.5mg/L, she has settled into the ideal range!
               Her blood tests are only slightly worse than the month prior, but the vet doesn't seem concerned.
               The gurgle in her lungs is not really there. We can finally relax. She won't be tested for another two months. </li>
            <li><em><strong> August 8 </strong></em> - Seymour, our newest roommate moves in. Miaou doesn't really trust him much
              for the first few weeks. She spends most of her time following him from a distance. His energy is rediculous in her eyes.</li>
            <li><em><strong> August </strong></em> - Unless symptoms occure with season change, she is in the clear.
               We are finally ready to give her give her fenbendazole, the anti-worm medication. In her case, preventative.  </li>
            <li><em><strong> September </strong></em> - Seymour and Miaou play together multiple times a day. Besides the lung damage, her lack
            of size, and the regular coughing fits, she really does seem like a whole other cat. When I met her at 5 months old, she was cold,
             coughy, and lethargic. Now 9 months later, she can run, she plays with us, and she goes for walks.   </li>
             <li><em><strong>2021</strong></em>	2021</li>
